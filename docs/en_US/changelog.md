>If there is no information for a given update, it means that it concerns only the update of documentation, translation or text.

# 3/12/2022
Added an Info command giving the number of tokens remaining to be consumed by the end of the day on the Netro API.

# 11/11/2022
Finalization of the English translation. The translation of the command names is performed when synchronizing. It is therefore necessary to redo a synchronization after having changed the language if you want the commands in the target language. All properties of existing commands are preserved so that the name change has no impact otherwise.
